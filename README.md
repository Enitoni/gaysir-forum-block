# gaysir-forum-block

A userscript that lets you hide or fade out posts from certain users on the Gaysir forum.

## Installing

Make sure you have a userscript extension installed in your browser. The most common ones are Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey.

[Then, click this link to install.](https://github.com/Enitoni/gaysir-forum-block/raw/main/index.user.js)

## Usage

If the installation was successful, you will now have a "block" button in the bottom line of posts. Click this button to select the block mode for the user.

-   Fade, This option will simply fade the posts out a bit, so they are less in the way. This is ideal if you wish to still be able to follow the conversation.

-   Block, This option will completely block the author and post content. This also includes quotes, but only if the quote was not altered to remove the first part.

Either mode will also remove all buttons except the block button, so that the post cannot be interacted with.

Note that users you have blocked via Gaysir itself, cannot be blocked via the extension as there is no way to retrieve their id and name.
