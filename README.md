# gaysir-forum-block

A userscript that lets you hide or fade out posts from certain users on the Gaysir forum.

## Installing

Make sure you have a userscript extension installed in your browser. The most common ones are Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey.

[Then, click this link to install.](https://github.com/Enitoni/gaysir-forum-block/raw/main/index.user.js)

## Usage

If the installation was successful, you will now have a "block" button in the bottom line of posts. Click this button to select the block mode for the user.

Note that users you have blocked via Gaysir itself, cannot be blocked via the extension as there is no way to retrieve their id and name.
